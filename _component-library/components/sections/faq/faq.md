## Overview
**Introduction:**  
Use this section to show Frequently Asked Questions in a tidy, tap-to-open list. Questions are grouped into **categories** (for example, “Getting Started”, “Billing”, “Troubleshooting”). Visitors can open a single answer or expand/collapse the whole category.

**Key Features:**  
- **Categories:** Group related questions so people can find answers faster.  
- **Expand/Collapse:** Open one answer at a time, or use the **Open/Close All** button for the current category.  
- **Mobile-friendly:** Always one column on phones; you can switch to two columns on larger screens.  
- **Optional heading:** Add a title and short intro at the top (recommended).

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:**  
- Help Center or Support page with sections like Account, Payments, Orders.  
- Service pages answering common pre-sale questions.  
- Policy pages where answers are short and easy to scan.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:**  
- **Empty categories:** Don’t add a category without any questions—it will look broken.  
- **Very long answers:** Huge paragraphs are hard to read. Keep answers short and skimmable.  
- **Too many questions in one category:** Split large groups into smaller, clearer categories.  
- **Forcing everything open:** Opening all answers by default on a long page makes it hard to scan.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **How do I create categories?**  
  In the editor, add a category name (e.g., “Billing”) and then add the questions and answers under it.

- **Can I show two columns?**  
  Yes. In the style settings, switch **Content Style** to **Double**. On phones it will still show one column for readability.

- **Can some answers start open?**  
  Yes. When adding a question, enable **Open by Default**. Use this sparingly.

- **What does “Open/Close All” do?**  
  It expands or collapses all answers in the **currently visible category**. This helps visitors read everything in that category quickly.

- **Nothing shows up—why?**  
  Check that you’ve added at least one category and each category has at least one question with an answer.

**Pro tips:**  
- Use short titles for questions.  
- Break longer answers into short paragraphs or bullet points.  
- Link to a full article or page if an answer needs more detail.

## Ideas
**Suggested Combinations:**  
- **Contact or Support CTA:** Add a small “Still need help?” button below the FAQs that opens a contact form.  
- **Related links:** Add a text block under the FAQs with links to guides, tutorials, or policies.
