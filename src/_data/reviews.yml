    So, long story short... my old Bailey needed serious help!!! Too may years
    worn all the time, except when it was sitting on the dash of the truck.
    Jorge reformed and cleaned it to the point my friends thought I got a new
    hat! The fit is still excellent and the brim is better formed than I ever
    expected. Jorge, you've got a lifetime customer!

    Authentic hats sold in a storefront attached to the family’s home. A variety
    of styles and brands made in the US and Mexico. I send any visitor to Idaho
    by the Idaho Hat Co to mark their time here. A quiet jewel in the middle of
    Nampa.

    I could not find any other hats I liked anywhere else, came here and I’ve
    never been happier. Very nice older man gave me an amazing deal on my hat!!!
    A $100 dollar hat for way cheaper than ever needed to be!!! This is awesome
    and would definitely recommend!

    Jorge is AWESOME! Cannot recommend him enough. I went in to get my hat
    reshaped (brim and crown) and he went above and beyond. He even replaced the
    filler in my hat and made sure it was perfect before even walking out!

    Listen… this place is magic. If you know you know and then you’ll always
    come back because you know :) I have a very small head and was treated like
    gold, Jorge is the ABSOLUTE BEST!

    Don't waste your time elsewhere, this is where you wanna buy western hats in
    the Treasure Valley. Jorge was supremely helpful in finding a variety of
    hats to try on and shaping them. Will return!
