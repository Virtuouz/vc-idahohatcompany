    So, long story short... my old Bailey needed serious help!!! Too may years
    worn all the time, except when it was sitting on the dash of the truck.
    Jorge reformed and cleaned it to the point my friends thought I got a new
    hat! The fit is still excellent and the brim is better formed than I ever
    expected. Jorge, you've got a lifetime customer!

    Authentic hats sold in a storefront attached to the familyâ€™s home. A variety
    of styles and brands made in the US and Mexico. I send any visitor to Idaho
    by the Idaho Hat Co to mark their time here. A quiet jewel in the middle of
    Nampa.
